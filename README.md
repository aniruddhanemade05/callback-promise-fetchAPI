JSONPlaceholder
JSONPlaceholder is a free online REST API that provides fake data for testing and prototyping. Developers use it to simulate API calls, making it easy to build and test applications without a backend.

Promises and Callbacks
Callbacks are functions executed after an async task completes. Promises represent the eventual result of an async operation, allowing for more manageable and readable code by chaining tasks and handling success or failure with .then() and .catch().
